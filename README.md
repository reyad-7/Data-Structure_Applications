# Data-Structure_Applications

Welcome to my data structure application repository! This project contains implementation of several important data structures.
including : single and doubly linked lists, array-based lists, stacks and queues.

Each of these data structures has its own unique characteristics and use cases.

Single and doubly linked lists are useful for maintaining a collection of elements with the ability to efficiently add or remove elements from the beginning, end, or middle of the list. Array-based lists, on the other hand, are better suited for situations where random access to elements is required.
Stacks and queues are useful for managing data in a first-in-first-out (FIFO) or last-in-first-out (LIFO) manner, respectively.
Stacks are commonly used for keeping track of function calls, while queues are often used in scenarios such as task scheduling or message passing.

I hope that these implementations are helpful for you in learning more about data structures and their applications. If you have any questions or feedback.
please don't hesitate to reach out!
